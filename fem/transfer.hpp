/** The forward, coarse-to-fine, transfer uses L2 projection. The backward,
    fine-to-coarse, transfer is defined locally (on a coarse element) as
    B = (F^t M_f F)^{-1} F^t M_f, where F is the forward transfer matrix, and

    elements.

    This class currently only fully supports L2 finite element spaces and fine
    meshes that are a uniform refinement of the coarse mesh. Generally, the
    coarse and fine FE spaces can have different orders, however, in order for
    the backward operator to be well-defined, the number of the fine dofs (in a
    coarse element) should not be smaller than the number of coarse dofs.

    If used on H1 finite element spaces, the transfer will be performed locally,
    and the value of shared (interface) degrees of freedom will be determined by
    the value of the last transfer to be performed (according to the element
    numbering in the finite element space). As a consequence, the mass
    conservation properties for this operator from the L2 case do not carry over
    to H1 spaces. */
